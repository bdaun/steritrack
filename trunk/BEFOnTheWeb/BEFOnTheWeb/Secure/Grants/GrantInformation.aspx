<p>
    Please complete the <a href="GrantManagement.aspx" style="font-weight:bold">Electronic Grant Submission</a> form. You can save partially completed 
    grant submissions.  However, once the form has been submitted, you may no longer edit the form. Following your electronic submission, the grant 
    information will be routed for review by the principal of your school. If you grant request is approved by your principal, it will then be 
    reviewed by the BEF Grant Committee. You can review the status of your grant at any time by logging on to the <a href="Home.aspx">BEF
    <span style="font-style:italic">OnTheWeb</span></a> site.</p>
<p>
	Electronic submissions will be evaluated using the <a href="GrantRubric.aspx">Grant Evaluation Rubric</a>.  A successful grant application will 
    include: 1) Project Activity Description, 2) Needs Assessment, 3) Measurable Goals and Objectives, 4) Assessment/Evaluation Strategy, and 
    5) Project Budget.  Award presentations will be made in May.  All grants awarded are one-time grants and should not be construed as 
    establishing a precedent for further support.
<br /><br />
	The Final Report on your project or activity must be completed for review by the Foundation by Monday, March 10, 2014, or within 30 days of your 
    project's completion.  You can complete the Final Report on the <a href="~/secure/Home.aspx">BEF <span style="font-style:italic">OnTheWeb</span></a> site 
    by selecting your current grant project with an "Awaiting Final Report" status. This data is important to the School Corporation and the Brownsburg 
    Education Foundation.  The Final Report should include the assessment criteria and whether you believe that you met the anticipated goals and 
    objectives of the grant project.
</p>
<h3>Please note</h3>
    <ol>
		<li style="margin-bottom:10px">If the Grant Application Submission includes the names of two or more people who are combining efforts on one project, one name must be identified
		as the "Primary Contact". The Staff Grant Committee will coordinate all communications and reimbursements with the Primary Contact. This person will be
		responsible for communicating with the remaining individuals involved in the project. </li>
        <li style="margin-bottom:10px">Subsequent grants will not be awarded if the Final Report is not submitted by the recipient(s).</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom:10px">In the event that you do not return to a position within the Brownsburg Community School Corporation during the 2013-2014 school year, the awarded
		funds must be reimbursed to the Foundation.</li>
